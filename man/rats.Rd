\title{ Tumor Incidence in Historical Control Groups and Current Group of Rats    }
\description{
   In the evaluation of drugs for possible clinical application, studies
   are routinely performed on rodents.  For a particular study drawn from the
   statistical literature, suppose the immediate aim is to estimate theta, 
   the probability of tumor in a population of female laboratory rats of type 
   'F344' that receive  a zero dose of the drug --- a control group. This 
   gives data from historical control groups, and one current experimental control group.
